## Mega Rocket GYM - App
Mega Rocket is a web application for a gym that provides a complete online training experience with personalized user accounts. Users can access a variety of live and on-demand classes and personalized training plans. In the next lines, we will detail the progress in the development of the app.

## Week 01
During week, we used Figma to design a landing page for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. We learned how to use design tools, create a color palette, and choose appropriate fonts to create a visually appealing and consistent design.

## Week 02
During week, we structured a webpage using HTML with an emphasis on semantic tags. We used appropriate tags to create an organized layout and a user-friendly design. We structure the html page with different tags in order to achieve a good visualization in their SEO.

## Week 03
During week, we styled a landing page using CSS to achieve a pixel-perfect design without responsiveness. We explored various CSS techniques and created a separate CSS file for the project. We create 2 CSS files, the styles, with general labels, and the reset file, which just resets parameters for better performance. We use commands like 'position-relative', 'widht', 'height', 'background-color', 'color', 'font-size'.

## Week 04
During this week, we created a responsive landing page with a mobile-first approach. We utilized Flexbox to achieve a flexible and responsive layout for the website. In the mobile version we use a structure based on 1 column through flexbox while in tablet and deskop we use 2 columns. And we also use media queries for the responsive design in these last two views.
