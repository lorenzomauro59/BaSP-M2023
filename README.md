## Week 01
During week, we used Figma to design a landing page for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. We learned how to use design tools, create a color palette, and choose appropriate fonts to create a visually appealing and consistent design.

## Week 02
During week, we structured a webpage using HTML with an emphasis on semantic tags. We used appropriate tags to create an organized layout and a user-friendly design.

## Week 03
During week, we styled a landing page using CSS to achieve a pixel-perfect design without responsiveness. We explored various CSS techniques and created a separate CSS file for the project.

## Week 04
